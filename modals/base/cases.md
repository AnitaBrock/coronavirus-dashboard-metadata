COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK to be tested for COVID-19 antigens. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.  If a person has had more than one positive test they are only counted as one case.

Data can be presented by specimen date (the date when the sample was taken from the person being tested) or by reporting date (the date the case was first included in the published totals).  The availability of each of these time series varies by area.

National data are not directly comparable due to differences in data collection and reporting (see below). 

Initially only cases identified through pillar 1 testing were included but cases identified through pillar 2 testing (see below) have been included since 15th June for Scotland, 26th June for Northern Ireland, 2nd July for England and 14th July for Wales.  This is why there are step increases in the time series for each nation.  

#### England

In combining the data for pillars 1 and 2 on 2 July around 30,000 duplicates were found and removed from the data.  These are people who have tested positive via a pillar 1 test and a pillar 2 test.  This is why the number of cases reported reduced from 1 July to 2 July.

#### Scotland

Scotland's data include a batch of cases for which specimen date was not available over a 10 day period between 15 and 25 April. These samples were assigned a specimen date in the midpoint within this range (20 April) causing the artificial spike in the chart.

#### Wales

On 14 July Wales included 842 historic pillar 2 cases that had not previously been reported, these caused an increase in the reported UK total.
