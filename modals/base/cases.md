COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK to be tested. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.  If a person has had more than one positive test they are only counted as one case.

Data can be presented by specimen date (the date when the sample was taken from the person being tested) or by reporting date (the date the case was first included in the published totals).  The availability of each of these time series varies by area.

Data for England, Northern Ireland and Scotland include cases identified through pillars 1 and 2 of the government's mass testing programme (see below).  Data for Wales include all pillar 1 cases and some pillar 2 cases.
