COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK to be tested for COVID-19 antigens. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.  If a person has had more than one positive test they are only counted as one case.

Data can be presented by specimen date (the date when the sample was taken from the person being tested) or by reporting date (the date the case was first included in the published totals).  The availability of each of these time series varies by area.  

Up to 20th August, a time series of positive cases by specimen date was published on the [Coronavirus daily statistics webpage](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#time-series-documents) for the UK and the four nations. This page has now been retired although the version published on August 20th remains available. This time series is not currently available in this dashboard for Northern Ireland or the UK but we are working to make this available in the near future. 

Cases are allocated to the person's area of residence.

UK data include results from both pillar 1 and pillar 2 testing.  Up to 1 July, these data were collected separately meaning that people who had tested positive via both methods were counted twice.  In combining the data for pillars 1 and 2 on 2 July around 30,000 duplicates were found and removed from the data.  This is why the number of cases reported reduced from 1 July to 2 July.

For the four nations, initially only cases identified through pillar 1 testing were included but cases identified through pillar 2 testing (see below) have been included, from different dates, for all nations.

#### England

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 2 July, from when pillar 2 cases are also included.

#### Northern Ireland

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 26 June, from when pillar 2 cases are also included.

#### Scotland

Data include only pillar 1 cases until 15 June, from when pillar 2 cases are also included. Scotland's data include a batch of cases for which specimen date was not available over a 10 day period between 15 and 25 April. These samples were assigned a specimen date in the midpoint within this range (20 April) causing the artificial spike in the chart.

#### Wales

Data include mainly pillar 1 cases until 14 July, from when pillar 2 cases have been included. This included 842 historic pillar 2 cases that had not previously been reported in the UK total, causing an increase in the UK total.
