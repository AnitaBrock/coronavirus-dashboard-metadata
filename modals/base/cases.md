COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK to be tested. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.  If a person has had more than one positive test they are only counted as one case.

Data can be presented by specimen date (the date when the sample was taken from the person being tested) or by reporting date (the date the case was first included in the published totals).  The availability of each of these time series varies by area.

Data from the start of the epidemic include cases identified through pillar 1 testing (see below) for each nation.

More recent data for each nation include cases identified through pillar 2 as well.  Scotland data include pillar 2 tests from 15 June onwards, Northern Ireland data from 26 June onwards, England data from 2 July onwards and Wales data from 14 July onwards.  This is why there are step increases in the time series for each nation.

Scotland's data include a batch of cases for which specimen date was not available over a 10 day period between 15 and 25 April. These samples were assigned a specimen date in the midpoint within this range (20 April) causing the artificial spike in the chart.

In combining the data for pillars 1 and 2 on 2 July around 30,000 duplicates were found and removed from the data.  These are people who have tested positive via a pillar 1 test and a pillar 2 test.  This is why the number of cases reported reduced from 1 July to 2 July.

On 14 July when Wales included 842 historic pillar 2 cases not previously reported, these caused an increase in the reported UK total.
