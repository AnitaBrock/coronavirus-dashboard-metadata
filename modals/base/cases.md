COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK to be tested. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.  If a person has had more than one positive test they are only counted as one case.

Data can be presented by specimen date (the date when the sample was taken from the person being tested) or by reporting date (the date the case was first included in the published totals).  The availability of each of these time series varies by area.

Data published from 2 July 2020 onwards for England, Northern Ireland and Scotland include cases identified through pillars 1 and 2 of the government's mass testing programme (see below).

Data for Wales do not include cases diagnosed by tests conducted in non-NHS Wales laboratories. These cases are also excluded from the UK total.

In combining the data for pillars 1 and 2 around 30,000 duplicates were found and removed from the data.  These are people who have tested positive via a pillar 1 test and a pillar 2 test.  This is why the number of cases reported reduced from 1 July to 2 July.
