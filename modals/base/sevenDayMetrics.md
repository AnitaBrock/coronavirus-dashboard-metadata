#### Seven day metrics

Metrics representing the last seven days are provided to give insight into what is happening with the COVID-19 epidemic in real time.

Counts show the total number of events that were reported in the seven day period ending on the date shown.

The change in the seven day count shows the difference between the seven day count for the latest period and the seven day count for the previous, non-overlapping, seven day period. Positive changes represent increasing trends and are indicated by an upwards arrow. Negative changes represent decreasing trends and are indicated by a downwards arrow. In cases where an area's previous seven day count was suppressed (counts of 0-2) but the latest seven day count is displayed, the previous seven day count will have been assumed to have been 2 when calculating the change in the seven day count. The percentage change is also calculated by expressing this change as a percentage of the previous seven day count. 

For metrics for which movement in a particular direction can be defined as good or bad, the seven day change figures are displayed on a green background to indicate that the metric is moving in the desired direction or a red background to indicate that the metric is moving in an undesirable direction.

Seven day rates are crude rates expressed per 100,000 population and are calculated by dividing the seven day count by the area population and multiplying by 100,000.
