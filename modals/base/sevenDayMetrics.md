#### Seven day metrics

Metrics representing the last seven days are provided to give insight into what is happening with the COVID-19 epidemic in real time.

Counts show the total number of events that were reported in seven day period ending on the date shown.

A comparison to the previous, non-overlapping, seven day period is shown on a coloured background with red indicating an increasing trend and green indicating a decreasing trend.  This comparison is expressed as a count and a percentage change with directional arrow.  Positive changes represent increasing trends and negative changes represent decreasing trends.  The percentage change is calculated by subtracting the seven day count for the previous, non-overlapping, seven day period from the latest seven day count and then dividing this difference by the seven day count for the previous seven day period and multiplying by 100.  

Seven day rates are expressed per 100,000 population and are calculated by dividing the seven day count by the area population and multiplying by 100,000.
