The definitions vary by nation and can be presented by date of death or by reporting date (the date the case was first included in the published totals).  The availability of each of these time series varies by area.

The data do not include deaths of people who had COVID-19 but had not been tested or people who had been tested negative and subsequently caught the virus and died.

Deaths of people who have tested positively for COVID-19 could in some cases be due to a different cause.
