Number of deaths of people who had had a positive test result for COVID-19. The actual cause of death may not be COVID-19 in all cases. People who died from COVID-19 but had not tested positive are not included.

Death data can be presented in two ways and the availability of each of these time series varies by area:

* Deaths by date of death - each death is assigned to the date that the person died irrespective of how long it took for the death to be reported.  Previously reported data are therefore continually updated
* Deaths by date reported - each death is assigned to the date when it was first included in the published totals.  The specific 24 hour periods reported against each date vary by nation and are defined below

#### England

Data on COVID-19 associated deaths in England are produced by Public Health England (PHE) from multiple sources linked to confirmed case data.  Deaths newly reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 5pm on the previous day. Deaths are included if the deceased had had a positive test for COVID-19, however long after the test they died. Full details of the methodology are available on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary).

#### Northern Ireland

Data for Northern Ireland include all cases reported to the Public Health Agency (PHA) where the deceased had a positive test for COVID-19 and died within 28 days. COVID-19 may not have been the cause of death in some cases. Deaths caused by COVID-19 more than 28 days after the positive test are not included. PHA sources include reports by healthcare workers (eg Health and Social Care Trusts, GPs) and information from local laboratory reports. Deaths reported against each date cover the 24 hours up to 9:30am on the previous day.  The deaths are reported a day earlier by the Northern Ireland Department of Health.

#### Scotland

Data for Scotland include deaths in all settings which have been registered with National Records of Scotland (NRS) where a laboratory confirmed report of COVID-19 in the 28 days prior to death exists. COVID-19 may not have been the cause of death in some cases. Deaths caused by COVID-19 more than 28 days after the positive test are not included. Deaths reported against each date cover the 24 hours up to 9:30am on the previous day.  The deaths are reported a day earlier by the Scottish Government.

#### Wales

Data for Wales include reports to Public Health Wales of deaths of hospitalised patients in Welsh Hospitals or care home residents where COVID-19 has been confirmed with a positive laboratory test and the clinician suspects this was a causative factor in the death.  The figures do not include individuals who may have died from COVID-19 but who were not confirmed by laboratory testing, those who died in other settings, or Welsh residents who died outside of Wales.  Deaths reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 5pm on the previous day.
