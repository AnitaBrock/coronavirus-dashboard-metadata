Testing Pillars

The government's mass testing programme includes four types of tests known as pillars:

* Pillar 1: NHS and PHE Testing – PCR swab testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers
* Pillar 2: Commercial partner testing – PCR swab testing for the wider population, as set out in government guidance - pillar 2 testing reported in this dashboard only includes tests that were processed by a lab
* Pillar 3: Antibody testing – antibody serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19, reported from 1st June onwards
* Pillar 4: Surveillance testing – antibody serology and PCR swab testing for national surveillance supported by PHE, ONS, Biobank, universities and other partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, for example on the accuracy and ease of use of home testing

More information on the government’s national testing strategy, and the methodology used to report numbers of tests, is available on the Department for Health and Social Care website:
