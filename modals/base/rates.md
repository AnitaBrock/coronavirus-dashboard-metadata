#### Rate calculations

Rates are calculated in order to compare areas or population groups of different sizes.
All rates currently presented on this website are crude rates, ie the count (eg cases or deaths)
is divided by the denominator population, without any adjustment for other factors.

Populations used are Office for National Statistics 2019 mid-year estimates, except for NHS Regions,
for which 2019 estimates are not yet available, so 2018 mid-year estimates are used.
