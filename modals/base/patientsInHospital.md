Each hospital trust reports daily on the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital at midnight the preceding night. The UK figure is the sum of the four nations' figures and can only be calculated when all nations' data are available.  Data are not reported by each nation every day.  Caution is needed when interpreting the data as the definitions are not always consistent between the four nations.

#### England

Data only include NHS Hospital Acute Trusts with a type 1 A&E department and are reported daily by trusts to NHS England and NHS Improvement.

#### Northern Ireland

Data published before 12 August 2020 included suspected cases as well as confirmed cases.  The full series was revised on 12 August.

#### Scotland

On 11 September 2020 the data were updated to exclude people (in larger NHS Boards) who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 but remain in hospital for another reason.  Further details about the data are available in the Trends in daily COVID-19 data spreadsheets available on the [Scottish Government website[(https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-trends-in-daily-data/)
