National data may not be directly comparable as data about COVID-19 patients in hospitals are collected differently across nations. Data are not updated at weekends and data are not all provided from each nation every day, so the UK figure presented may lag as it is calculated by summing the four nations' counts.

England data are for NHS Hospital Acute Trusts with a type 1 A&E department.

England, Northern Ireland and Scotland data include 'confirmed' COVID-19 cases; from 26 May, data for Wales include 'confirmed' and 'recovering' patients.
