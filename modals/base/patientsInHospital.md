Each hospital trust reports daily on the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital at midnight the preceding night. The UK figure is the sum of the four nations' figures and can only be calculated when all nations' data are available.  Data are not reported by each nation every day.  Caution is needed when interpreting the data as the definitions are not always consistent between the four nations.

#### England

Data only include NHS Hospital Acute Trusts with a type 1 A&E department and are reported daily by trusts to NHS England and NHS Improvement.

#### Scotland

Details about the data are available in the Trends in daily COVID-19 data spreadsheets available on the [Scottish Government website[(https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-trends-in-daily-data/)
