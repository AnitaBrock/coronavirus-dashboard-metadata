Coronavirus tests are processed in many laboratories around the UK. Projected laboratory capacity is an estimate of the number of tests each lab can process each day based on the availability of staff, chemical reagents and other resources required. These estimates are made locally by the labs themselves, aggregated and published weekly by the Department for Heath and Social Care.

Testing capacity data are available for the UK only so data cannot be presented separately for the four nations.

Testing capacity data are available for all pillars combined or for different pillar combinations.  Capacity for pillar 1 and 2 testing combined is an estimate of PCR swab testing capacity.  Capacity for pillar 3 testing is an estimate of antibody serology testing capacity.  These are both 
estimates because pillar 4 surveillance testing includes both PCR and antibody testing and utilises the testing capacity for pillars 2 and 4.
