Lab-based coronavirus tests are processed in many laboratories around the UK. Projected laboratory capacity is an estimate of the number of tests each lab can process each day based on the availability of staff, chemical reagents and other resources required. These estimates are made locally by the labs themselves, aggregated and published weekly by the Department for Heath and Social Care.

Testing capacity data are available by test type:  
* Lab-based virus tests that test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus.  This includes lab-based pillar 1 and 2 tests and virus tests undertaken in pillar 4.
* Antibody serology tests that test for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies.  This includes pillar 3 tests antibody serology tests undertaken in pillar 4. 

Testing capacity data are available for the UK only so data cannot be presented separately for the four nations.
