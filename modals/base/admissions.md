The UK figure is the sum of the four nations' figures and can only be calculated when all nations' data are available.  Data are not reported by each nation every day.  Caution is needed when interpreting the data as the definitions are not always consistent between the four nations.

#### England

England data include people admitted to hospital who already had a confirmed COVID-19 status at point of admission, and those who tested positive in the 24 hours previous to the reporting date whilst in hospital. Inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 after admission are reported as being admitted on the day prior to their diagnosis.

#### Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland data include confirmed COVID-19 admissions by admission date.

#### Scotland

Data for Scotland include admissions into hospital for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission, or during their stay in hospital. The data are published weekly by [Public Health Scotland](

#### Wales

Wales data include confirmed and suspected cases, and are the numbers of admissions to the hospital in the previous 24 hour period up to 9am. The status of COVID/non-COVID is as at the time of reporting, not at time of admission.
