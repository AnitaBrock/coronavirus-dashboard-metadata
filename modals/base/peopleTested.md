NOT FINISHED - REFER TO cases.md

People tested includes all individuals who have had one or more lab-confirmed positive or negative COVID-19 PCR test results.

COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK for PCR swab testing. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.  If a person has had more than one test result they are only counted as one person tested.  If any of their tests were positive they count as a case.  If all their tests were negative they count as one person tested negative.  The people tested figure is the sum of cases and people tested negative.

Initially only pillar 1 tests were included but pillar 2 tests have been included since 15th June for Scotland, 26th June for Northern Ireland, 2nd July for England and 14th July for Wales (see below).
