People tested includes all individuals who have been tested and had one or more positive or negative test results.

COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK to be tested. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.  If a person has had more than one test result they are only counted as one person tested.  If any of their tests were positive they count as a case.  If all their tests were negative they count as one person tested negative.  The people tested figure is the sum of cases and people tested negative.

Data for England and Wales include only cases identified through pillar 1 of the government's mass testing programme (see below).

Data for Northern Ireland and Scotland include cases identified through pillars 1 and 2.

The UK total is not the sum of the 4 National totals as the pillar 2 cases are not included in the National totals for England and Wales.
