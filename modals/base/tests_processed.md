**More general information on testing**

There are three types of test being carried out:  
* Lab-based virus tests that test for the presence of COVID-19.  These include lab-based pillar 1 and 2 tests and virus tests undertaken in pillar 4.
* Antibody serology tests that test for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies.  These include pillar 3 tests and antibody serology tests undertaken in pillar 4.  All pillar 4 antibody testing is reported as England by DHSC.
* Lateral flow device virus tests that test for the presence of COVID-19.  These are swab tests that give results in less than an hour, without needing to go to a laboratory. Lateral flow device tests have been used in trials of mass testing in schools, universities and care homes, and have been available for those who live or work in Liverpool for a two-week period from 6 November 2020. Lateral flow device test data are currently available for England only and are reported separately to lab-based virus tests processed.

#### UK

UK data are available for virus testing and antibody serology testing. UK Data are not available for weekends between 4 July and 10 August 2020 because Northern Ireland did not report at weekends during this period.  

#### England and Wales

Data are only available from 1 April 2020. Up to 13 July 2020, only pillar 1 lab-based tests were included. Pillar 2 lab-based tests are available from 14 July 2020.

For England, lateral flow device tests are available from 21 October 2020.

#### Northern Ireland

Data are only available from 22 April 2020. Up to 2 July 2020, only pillar 1 tests were included. Pillar 2 tests are available from 3 July 2020.  Northern Ireland did not report at weekends between 4 July and 10 August 2020, so daily figures for Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays are missing and cumulative figures shown on Saturdays and Sundays are figures for the previous Friday.

#### Scotland

Data are only available from 1 April 2020. Pillar 1 tests were included throughout the time series, but pillar 2 tests have been added at various times.

Until 7 July 2020, the total number of COVID-19 tests carried out each day by Regional Testing Centres (RTC) as part of pillar 2 of the UK Government's testing programme were reported through the Department of Health and Social Care based on data from the contractors who operate the centres. This included tests done at the drive through centres and mobile units, but not tests processed from home testing kits.

From 8 July 2020 onwards, the total number of COVID-19 tests with results in the Health Protection Scotland ECOSS system reported from the UK Government testing programme are reported, including those processed from home testing kits and the social care portal, as well as drive throughs and mobile units. These now reflect all test results reported on across pillars 1 and 2.  Void tests are not included.
