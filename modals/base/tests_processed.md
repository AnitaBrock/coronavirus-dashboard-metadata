There are two types of test being carried out:  
* PCR swab tests that test for the presence of COVID-19 antigens.  These include pillar 1 and 2 tests and PCR swab tests undertaken in pillar 4.
* Antibody serology tests that test for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies.  These include pillar 3 tests and antibody serology tests undertaken in pillar 4.  All pillar 4 antibody testing is reported as England by DHSC.

#### UK

UK data are available for PCR swab testing and antibody serology testing.  

#### England and Wales

Northern Ireland did not report at weekends between 4 July and 10 August, so daily figures for Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays are missing and cumulative figures shown on Saturdays and Sundays are figures for the previous Friday.

#### Scotland

Data are only available from 1 April 2020. Pillar 1 tests were included throughout the time series, but pillar 2 tests have been added at various times.

Until 7 July 2020, the total number of COVID-19 tests carried out each day by Regional Testing Centres (RTC) as part of pillar 2 of the UK Government's testing programme were reported through the Department of Health and Social Care based on data from the contractors who operate the centres. This included tests done at the drive through centres and mobile units, but not tests processed from home testing kits.

From 8 July 2020 onwards, the total number of COVID-19 tests with results in the Health Protection Scotland ECOSS system reported from the UK Government testing programme are reported, including those processed from home testing kits and the social care portal, as well as drive throughs and mobile units. These now reflect all test results reported on across pillars 1 and 2.  Void tests are not included.
