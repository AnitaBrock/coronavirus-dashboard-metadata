Tests made available or sent out but not processed are not included.

#### UK

UK data include results from all types of test (see below) but results from pillar 3 and 4 testing are not available by nation so are excluded from the individual nation data.  

#### England, Northern Ireland and Wales

Initially only results from pillar 1 testing were included but results from pillar 2 testing (see below) have been included since 8th July for Scotland, 3rd July for Northern Ireland, 14th July for England and 14th July for Wales.  This is why there are step increases in the time series for each nation.  

#### Scotland

Initially only results from pillar 1 testing were included but on 15th June Scotland included results from pillar 2 testing done at drive through centres and mobile units (but not home testing kits) - historic data have been updated to reflect these additional pillar 2 inclusions.  From 8th July results from all pillar 2 testing were included - this is why there is a step increase in the time series at this point.
