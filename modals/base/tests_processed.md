Tests processed by laboratories around the UK.  Tests made available or sent out but not processed are not included.

#### UK

UK data include all types of test (see below) but results from pillar 4 testing are not available by nation so are excluded from the individual nation data.

#### England and Wales

Data are only available from 1 April 2020. Up to 13 July 2020, only pillar 1 tests were included. The breakdown of pillar 2 tests by nation has been available since 14 July. From 8 August 2020 all pillar 3 cases are reported by DHSC as England.

#### Northern Ireland

Data are only available from 21 April 2020. Up to 2 July 2020, only pillar 1 tests were included. The breakdown of pillar 2 tests by nation has been available since 3 July.  Northern Ireland did not report at weekends between 4 July and 10 August, so cumulative figures shown on Saturdays and Sundays are figures for the previous Friday.

#### Scotland

Data are only available from 1 April 2020. Pillar 1 tests were included throughout the time series, but pillar 2 tests have been added at various times.

Until 7 July 2020, the total number of COVID-19 tests carried out each day by Regional Testing Centres (RTC) as part of pillar 2 of the UK Government's testing programme were reported through the Department of Health and Social Care based on data from the contractors who operate the centres. This included tests done at the drive through centres and mobile units, but not tests processed from home testing kits.

From 8 July 2020 onwards, the total number of COVID-19 tests with results in the Health Protection Scotland ECOSS system reported from the UK Government testing programme are reported, including those processed from home testing kits and the social care portal, as well as drive throughs and mobile units. These now reflect all test results reported on across pillars 1 and 2.  Void tests are not included.
