# Capacity Draft

Testing capacity data are available for all pillars combined or for different pillar combinations.  Capacity for pillar 1, 2 and 4 testing combined provides the best estimate of antigen swab testing capacity.  Capacity for pillar 3 testing provides the best estimate of antibody serology testing capacity.  These are both best estimates because pillar 4 surveillance testing includes both antigen and antibody testing and utilises the testing capacity for pillars 2 and 4.

# Testing Draft

Data are not reported by each nation every day so the UK data are only updated weekly.  Results from pillar 4 testing (see below) are not 
available by nation so are excluded from the individual nation data.  

#### UK

UK data are available for all types of testing or for different pillar combinations.  Pillar 1, 2 and 4 testing combined 
provides the best estimate of antigen swab tests processed.  Pillar 3 testing provides the best estimate of antibody serology 
tests processed. These are both best estimates because pillar 4 surveillance testing includes both antigen and antibody testing.
