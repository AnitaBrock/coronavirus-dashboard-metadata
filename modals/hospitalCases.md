# Patients in hospital

Total number of patients in hospital with COVID-19 on {date}.

National data may not be directly comparable as data about COVID-19 patients in hospitals are collected differently across nations. Data are not updated at weekends and data are not all provided from each nation every day, so the UK figure presented may lag as it is calculated by summing the four nations' counts.

England data are for NHS Hospital Acute Trusts with a type 1 A&E department.

England and Scotland data include 'confirmed' COVID-19 cases; Wales and Northern Ireland data include ‘confirmed’ and ‘suspected’ COVID-19 cases.

Due to the way Northern Ireland report, the UK figure is calculated by taking the most recent day for Great Britain plus the previous day for Northern Ireland.

Community hospitals are included in figures for Wales from 23 April onwards.
