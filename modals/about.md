## Daily and cumulative numbers of tests

The number of tests, across all types of testing, reported on or up to the latest reporting date.

These figures include all tests carried out and sent out as part of the government's mass testing programme.

The types of tests are known as pillars. They are:

* Pillar 1: NHS and PHE Testing – swab testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers
* Pillar 2: Commercial partner testing – swab testing for the wider population, as set out in government guidance - this includes in-person tests processed and tests sent out
* Pillar 3: Antibody testing – serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19
* Pillar 4: Surveillance testing – serology and swab testing for national surveillance supported by PHE, ONS, Biobank, universities and other partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, for example on the accuracy and ease of use of home testing

More information on the government’s national testing strategy and the methodology used to report numbers of tests are available on the Department for Health and Social Care website:

## Testing capacity

Total number of tests capable of being performed by laboratories on {date}.

Coronavirus tests are processed in a number of laboratories. Projected laboratory capacity is an estimate of each the number of tests all lab can process each day based on the availability staff, chemical reagents and other resources it requires. These estimates are made locally by the labs themselves, aggregated and reported by the Department for Heath and Social Care (DHSC).

The types of tests are known as pillars. They are:

* Pillar 1: NHS and PHE Testing – swab testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers
* Pillar 2: Commercial partner testing – swab testing for the wider population, as set out in government guidance - this includes in-person tests processed and tests sent out
* Pillar 3: Antibody testing – serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19
* Pillar 4: Surveillance testing – serology and swab testing for national surveillance supported by PHE, ONS, Biobank, universities and other partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, for example on the accuracy and ease of use of home testing

Further information on the methodology used to report capacity is available in the [testing methodology document](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-data-methodology) published by DHSC.

## Daily and cumulative numbers of cases 

Number of people with a lab-confirmed positive test newly reported on or up to the latest reporting date.

These figures include cases for the 4 Nations identified through NHS, PHE and commercial partner testing.

COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK to be tested. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.

There are separate reporting processes for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each Nation provides data based on tests carried out in NHS (and in England, PHE) laboratories. These represent 'pillar 1' of the Government's mass testing programme. The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) combines the counts from the 4 Nations, and adds data from tests carried out by commercial partners ('pillar 2' of the mass-testing programme) to give daily and total (cumulative) counts of lab-confirmed cases. These are submitted to Public Health England (PHE) to display on this website. The 4 figures are not all taken from the same cut-off time: England, Northern Ireland and Scotland counts are as at 9am on the day of publication; Wales counts are as at 7am on the day of publication.

The headline UK case count is published by DHSC each day via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and on the [DHSC website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public).

The UK total is not the sum of the 4 National totals as the pillar 2 cases are not included in the National totals for all parts of the UK - they are currently included for Wales, but not England, Northern Ireland or Scotland.

Information about the different pillars is available on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-our-testing-programmes).

Details of the processes for counting cases in the devolved administrations are available on their websites:

* [Scottish Government coronavirus information](https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/)
* [Public Health Wales coronavirus information](https://covid19-phwstatement.nhs.wales/)
* [Northern Ireland Department of Health coronavirus information](https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/news/)

## Daily and cumulative numbers of patients admitted to hospital

Numbers of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 on or up to the latest reporting date. 

England data include people admitted to hospital who already had a confirmed COVID-19 status at point of admission, and those who tested positive in the 24 hours previous to the reporting date whilst in hospital. Inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 after admission are reported as being admitted on the day prior to their diagnosis.

Northern Ireland data include suspected and confirmed COVID-19 admissions by admission date.

Data for Scotland include admissions into hospital for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission, or during their stay in hospital. The data are published weekly by [Public Health Scotland](
https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/population-health/covid-19/covid-19-statistical-report/) and currently cover the period up to {date}. Hence the latest figure available for the UK is also for this date.

Wales data include confirmed and suspected cases, and are the numbers of admissions to the hospital in the previous 24 hour period up to 9am. The status of COVID/non-COVID is as at the time of reporting, not at time of admission.

## Patients in hospital

Total number of patients in hospital with COVID-19 on {date}.

National data may not be directly comparable as data about COVID-19 patients in hospitals are collected differently across nations.

England data are for NHS Hospital Acute Trusts with a type 1 A&E department.

England and Scotland data include 'confirmed' COVID-19 cases; Wales and Northern Ireland data include ‘confirmed’ and ‘suspected’ COVID-19 cases.

Due to the way Northern Ireland report, the UK figure is calculated by taking the most recent day for Great Britain plus the previous day for Northern Ireland.

Community hospitals are included in figures for Wales from 23 April onwards.

## Patients in mechanical ventilation beds

Total number of mechanical ventilation beds that are occupied by COVID-19 patients on {date}.

England figures are the numbers of COVID-19 patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation and includes Nightingale hospitals.

Northern Ireland figures are the numbers COVID-19 patients in beds which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation.

Scottish figures include people in intensive care units with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and may include a small number of patients who are not on mechanical ventilation.

For Wales, mechanical ventilator beds include invasive ventilated beds in a critical care setting, plus those outside of a critical care environment. Beds in the Dragon's Heart/Ysbyty Calon y Ddraig field hospital are also included.

## Daily and cumulative COVID19-associated deaths

Total number of deaths of people who have had a positive test result for COVID-19 reported on or up to the latest reporting date.

The data do not include deaths of people who had COVID-19 but had not been tested or people who had been tested negative and subsequently caught the virus and died.

Deaths of people who have tested positively for COVID-19 could in some cases be due to a different cause.

### England

Data on COVID-19 deaths in England are produced by Public Health England (PHE). These data are taken from 3 different sources:

* NHS England: deaths are reported by NHS Trusts using the [COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS)](https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/04/C0389-update-to-cpns-reporting-letter-27-april-2020.pdf) (this includes only deaths in hospitals)

* PHE Health Protection Teams: the local teams report deaths notified to them (mainly deaths not in hospitals)

* Linking data on confirmed positive cases (identified through testing by NHS and PHE laboratories and commercial partners) to the NHS Demographic Batch Service: when a patient dies, the NHS central register of patients is notified (this is not limited to deaths in hospitals). The list of all lab-confirmed cases is checked against the NHS central register each day, to check if any of the patients have died.

Data on deaths from these 3 sources are linked to the list of people who have had a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by a PHE or NHS laboratory (pillar 1 of the government's mass testing strategy) or through testing in commerical labs (pillar 2). This is to identify as many people with a confirmed diagnosis who have died as possible.

Deaths will often appear in 2 or 3 different sources, so the records are checked and merged into one database and duplicates are removed so there is no double counting. Automated processes are used to ensure that the data are as complete as possible. Full details of the process of producing the data are available on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary).

The final list of deaths includes all deaths previously reported by [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/), but also includes other deaths of patients who were confirmed cases, whether they died in hospital or elsewhere.

Deaths reported for England each day cover the 24 hours up to 5pm on the day before the reporting date stated above.

### Northern Ireland

Data for Northern Ireland include all cases reported to the Public Health Agency (PHA) where the deceased had a positive test for COVID-19 and died within 28 days, whether or not COVID-19 was the cause of death.  PHA sources include reports by healthcare workers (eg Health and Social Care Trusts, GPs) and information from local laboratory reports. Deaths reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 9:30am on the day before the reporting date stated above.  The deaths are reported a day earlier by the Northern Ireland Department of Health.

### Scotland

Data for Scotland include deaths which have been registered with National Records of Scotland (NRS) where a laboratory confirmed report of COVID-19 in the 28 days prior to death exists. 

The daily total is an update of the data described above/previously, using the latest daily information received from NRS to check where a laboratory positive report for COVID-19 exists. These data include all deaths in individuals with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in Scotland and therefore include deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community.
 
This daily number of new deaths registered will not necessarily equal the number of deaths on a particular day, owing to the time allowed for families to register deaths. Numbers of registrations are also lower at weekends.

 Deaths reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 9:30am on the day before the reporting date stated above.  The deaths are reported a day earlier by the Scottish Government.

### Wales

Data for Wales include reports to Public Health Wales of deaths of hospitalised patients in Welsh Hospitals or care home residents where COVID-19 has been confirmed with a positive laboratory test and the clinician suspects this was a causative factor in the death. 

The figures do not include individuals who may have died from COVID-19 but who were not confirmed by laboratory testing, those who died in other settings, or Welsh residents who died outside of Wales.

Deaths reported each day cover the 24 hours up to 5pm on the day before the reporting date stated above.
